PROBLEM STATEMENT(Real-Time Equity Analysis under the theme of Improving Banking, Integrated apps)

  *  Real-time equity analysis involves continuously monitoring and analyzing stock prices, financial metrics, and other market data to provide insights into the performance of equity investments. In real-time equity analysis, data such as stock prices, trading volumes, earnings reports, and news are streamed live, processed, and visualized for immediate decision-making.

  *  Here we have created a Real-Time Equity Analysis Platform in which the user can login and check the equity status by manually enrolling the symbol(stock name) of a corporation.The live chart fetches the data from Alpha Vantage's Stock API lively updating with the help of websockets.


INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE PROJECT

Step 1 : Download the pre-requirements(such as libraries, modules, webesocket,etc..)
  *  Download python modules such as flask(mysqldb, cors, socketio), eventlet, requests, logging, threading. 
  *  Download javascript libraries as chart.js for plotting livechart.
  *  Download websockets(flask-sockets) for generating live dataset.

Step 2 : Create a database in MYSQL from xampp server and also create table with correct attributes.

Step 3 : Now run the backend python file ( i.e..python app.py).

Step 4 : Then run the frontend vue file (i.e..npm run dev) before running the frontend make sure to install npm (i.e..npm install)

Step 5 : Register and check if the user authentication values are added to table in the database.

Step 6 : Then move to dashboard and enter the symbol of the organisation you want to check (i.e..APPL for Apple Inc) and then check the live value in the chart.

Step 7 : If you have any queries from the website or from the shares an AI powered chatbot is available to solve your doubts.

Step 8 : After checking, please ensure to shutdown the software. At first the frontend must be shutdown and then the background(by clicking Ctrl+C for both of them).
